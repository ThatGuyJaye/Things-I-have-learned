# Things-I-have-learned
This is my first method of listing or showcasing the things I've learned. This is sure to evolve over time. 

Oh snap ðŸ˜¯ it looks like I didn't go through making changes. 


What have you actually DONE (This is what an old coworker told me when i was floating out self-given titles and grandiose dreams)

This will be the perfect name for my constantly evolving skill list!
